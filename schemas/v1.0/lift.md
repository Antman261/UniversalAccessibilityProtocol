Destinations can consist of either an array of named levels, or an object with named arrays. Both are demonstrated in lift.json

An array under `destinations` can include n-many ints.

A lift must include at least one of destinations or directives.

Directive `Go` is a toggle command used for lifts servicing only two levels.

Lifts requiring an unconscious disengage mechanism, directives and destinations can require press and hold. This is common in lifts without a fully enclosed capsule.
